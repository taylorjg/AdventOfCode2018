# My Approach

This year, I am coding in Node.js and my approach is as follows:

* Get the parsing working and commit
* Get some scruffy code for part 1 working and commit
* Get some scruffy code for part 2 working and commit
* Make several more commits as I refactor towards nicer code that is pure functional

I am making use of the following libraries:

* [Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/)
* [Immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/)
